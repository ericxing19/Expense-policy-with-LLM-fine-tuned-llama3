    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "GNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\n",
    "This policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scope\n",
    "This policy applies to all spend on GNEI activities including from research grants and discretionary accounts as well as departmental codes. \n",
    "This policy covers the following areas of expenditure:\n",
    "Travel\n",
    "Overnight costs and allowances\n",
    "Telephone and internet costs\n",
    "Entertainment & Hospitality\n",
    "Training\n",

    "For expense claim procedures, please refer to Annex 1.\n",
    "Generally, GNEI will not reimburse individuals for:\n",
    "Broadband/Internet Provision\n",
    "Equipment\n",
    "Fines\n",
    "Gifts\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Travel\n",
    "This section details what can be claimed as travel expenses and provides information on specific modes of transport and other expenses associated with travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "General guidance for travelling on GNEI business\n",
    "The cost of business travel, that is, journeys away from your normal place of work while undertaking GNEI business can be claimed.\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, all business trips in the UK or abroad must be authorised in writing in advance by the GNEI budget holder responsible for making the funds available. It is recommended that this is attached to the claim.\n",
    "The budget holder / manager must agree that the travel is necessary and that alternative methods such as conference call, video conference, phone or email cannot be used or are not appropriate. Consideration should also be given as to how to minimise the environmental impact of travel.\n",
    "This authorisation ensures that anticipated costs are in line with departmental plans, are eligible under the terms of any associated funding, and that subsequent expense claims can be submitted with confidence, subject to the provisions of this policy.\n",
    "GNEI has preferred travel suppliers for airline, hotel and car hire bookings details on these suppliers can be found on the Procurement website. These suppliers should be used for travel bookings where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private travel costs\n",
    "The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Travel between home and normal place of work.\n",
    "Business travel broadly similar to the claimant’s normal commute.\n",
    "Recreational travel and accommodation at or near the business travel destination.\n",
    "Travel or accommodation for family or friends accompanying the claimant on the business journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of exchange\n",
    "If a credit card was used to pay for overseas expenses, the rate charged by the credit card issuer can be claimed. A copy of the statement should be used to evidence the rate used.\n",
    "For employees GNEIExpenses will use a default rate for translating foreign currency transactions; this can be overridden if different to the rate at the time of expenditure and fluctuations will be allowed within a set tolerance. If the automatic rate is overridden, a copy of the bank statement should be included with the claim to back up the rate used.\n",
    "Buying foreign currency is not a genuine business expense and cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Insurance\n",
    "Travel Insurance needs to be activated before traveling overseas, travelling in the UK for fieldtrips or travelling on a business trip where there is an overnight stay or air travel involved.\n",
    "Insurance can be activated by completing a travel insurance request form, which can be found in the Insurance Section on the Finance website.\n",
    "The Insurance team will issue a cover note and provide details of the policy. There is no cost to departments for travel insurance. For regular travellers the Insurance Section can issue annual cover notes on request.\n",
    "If a claimant has an existing medical condition and is not travelling against their doctors’ orders, this is covered by the GNEI Travel Insurance Policy at no extra cost.\n",
    "Personal travel insurance cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel, please refer to Annex 2 for further information on this exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Transport\n",
    "Journeys made on rail, bus, ferry, river boat, underground, metro or tram services – can be claimed.\n",
    "The most economical method of travel should be used. For example, if the claimant uses public transport in London regularly, they should use an Oyster card rather than paying for single journeys by cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train journeys\n",
    "These should be standard class unless a heavily discounted first-class ticket is booked significantly in advance of the date of travel.\n",
    "If the claimant does travel first class, an explanation must be included on the claim and if necessary the claim will be passed to the relevant School or PS Head of Finance for approval.\n",
    "Trains should be booked in advance where possible via GNEI's approved travel provider or similar rail travel provider as this is the most cost effective option. Tickets can then be collected at the relevant station or sent via post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tube and bus journeys in London\n",
    "If a London Transport Oyster or contactless credit/debit card is used for business journeys, the details of each individual journey should be entered on the claim, being specific about locations, date and times and purpose of journey.\n",
    "Only the relevant journey should be claimed, not the whole top-up cost, unless the whole top-up will be used for GNEI business travel. Receipts are not necessary for individual journeys but are required if claiming for the whole top- up fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receipts\n",
    "Relevant tickets or documentation should be kept and attached to the expense claim electronically.\n",
    "Claimants who have a rail or Oyster season ticket enabled to use the underground can only claim for travel if extra expenses are incurred that are not covered by the season ticket and can provide a receipt as proof of the expense.\n",
    "Ticket machines will provide receipts if the ticket is retained by the automatic barrier at the end of a journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxis\n",
    "Taxi fares can only be claimed for journeys where:\n",
    "It is clearly the most efficient and cost-effective method of transport.\n",
    "Alternative methods of transport are impractical due to pregnancy, disability, illness or injury, luggage or similar.\n",
    "A member of staff is working in the office very late, i.e. after 11pm.\n",
    "Prior approval has been given, where feasible, from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Mileage\n",
    "If a car, motorcycle or bicycle has been used on a business trip the costs can be claimed using a mileage allowance – that is, a sum of money for every business mile travelled. GNEI does not reimburse claims based on actual petrol receipts.\n",
    "GNEI has standard rates for these allowances, depending on the circumstances surrounding the trip (see below).\n",
    "Only additional costs incurred, above what would normally be spent for commuting to work (which are not eligible as a business expense) can be claimed.\n",
    "A car should only be used if it is cheaper and more efficient than public transport. Cars should be shared with other staff members wherever possible.\n",
    "The claim should state the start and end points of the journey, along with the number of miles being claimed.\n",
    "Mileage is paid at the HMRC approved mileage allowance rates:\n",
    "Cars - 50p per mile for the first 11,000 miles in a tax year and 28p per mile thereafter.\n",
    "Motorcycles - 26p per mile.\n",
    "Bicycles - 22p per mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance\n",
    "It is important that adequate personal insurance cover for business use is in place, as cars, bicycles or motorcycles belonging to claimants are not covered by GNEI’s insurance. Personal insurance cannot be claimed, see Annex 2 for further information.\n",
    "If a staff member uses or allows another member of staff to use a vehicle on GNEI’s business that is insured for third party risks only, GNEI will not be held liable for any of the following:\n",
    "damage or repairs to the vehicle\n",
    "property lost or damaged\n",
    "personal injuries sustained or caused during or as a result of such use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car sharing\n",
    "Only the driver can claim mileage for a journey where two or more GNEI staff share a car. The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Insurance cover for private cars.\n",
    "Accident or breakdown recovery costs, such as AA membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Air Travel\n",
    "Air travel should be booked using GNEI’s preferred travel provider where possible.\n",
    "GNEI prefers lower fares, based on flight arrival and departure times which cannot be changed. Where there is a need for flexibility in departure or arrival times, a different ticket option will have to be requested. Flexible tickets for flights under three hours require approval by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "Membership of a frequent traveller scheme and potential air miles benefits must not deflect from using the most cost-effective airline option for travel.\n",
    "GNEI does not meet the travelling costs of:\n",
    "Employees of contractors\n",
    "Spouses, partners, other family members or friends.\n",
    "Classes of travel:\n",
    "For flights of five hours or less, staff should book restricted tickets in economy.\n",
    "For flights lasting five hours or longer staff may travel premium economy.\n",
    "Where a long international flight is immediately followed by a presentation or meeting, staff may travel by business class. This must be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toll charges\n",
    "Toll charges paid for in the course of a business journey can be claimed. Toll bridges or roads rarely give receipts; therefore the name of the toll bridge or road should be included on the expense claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congestion charges\n",
    "GNEI will not reimburse the cost of any congestion charge for staff or visitors except in exceptional circumstances, e.g. where a member of staff has to collect/deliver equipment to a location and the journey could not be completed on public transport. This must be approved in advance by the relevant School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Parking\n",
    "Reasonable parking costs on business visits and journeys away from the office can be claimed.\n",
    "Hotel parking costs can be claimed if they are charged separately on the bill.\n",
    "If a claimant has to drive to their place of work as part of a business journey, e.g. to collect equipment, parking costs can be claimed. Details of the reason should be included with the claim.\n",
    "The cost of parking at an entertainment venue cannot be claimed.\n",
    "VAT can be reclaimed (where it's charged) on parking fees which cost less than £28 even if the claimant is not able to get a VAT receipt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Hire\n",
    "Approval must be obtained from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager before a car is hired.\n",
    "If hiring a car is the cheapest mode of travel, it should be booked through GNEI's approved car hire provider (for UK or overseas).\n",
    "The car should only be used for business purposes.\n",
    "Rates are inclusive of CDW (Collision Damage Waiver), TPI (Third Party Insurance) and PAI (Personal Accident Insurance).\n",
    "Any petrol bought solely for business purposes can be claimed. A VAT receipt should be obtained for purchases, a credit card receipt is not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Travel\n",
    "This is in relation to a staff conference or student field trip. Prior approval from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager should be obtained before booking a group trip.\n",
    "The same rules apply for each category of travel and overnight costs as for travelling as an individual.\n",
    "All travel (including coach hire) and overnight costs should be booked in advance.\n",
    "GNEI's approved travel provider provides a group travel & conference booking facility, where all elements of the trip can be arranged. This can be used for arranging a business conference, as well as student field trips.\n",
    "Please ensure adequate insurance is in place for all staff and students on the trip. Travel insurance needs to be activated prior to the trip by using the Insurance section of the Finance website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Incidentals\n",
    "Claimants can claim the following goods or services if they are related to the business purpose of the trip:\n",
    "The cost of obtaining a visa for working abroad on GNEI business. These can be obtained from GNEI's approved travel provider.\n",
    "The cost of any vaccinations needed for working abroad.\n",
    "There may be occasions when a claimant needs a second passport, for example when travel to one country could lead to immigration difficulties in travelling on business to some other countries. GNEI will pay this expense.\n",
    "Approval must be obtained in advance from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Overnight costs and allowances\n",
    "Such costs are subject to the requirement for pre-approval in section 4.3 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotels\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, Hotels must be booked via GNEI's approved travel provider for both overseas and UK travel, with recovery through expenses only permitted in those cases set out in Section 3.1 of that policy and subject to an appropriate level of advance approval as set out in section 3.2. The approval obtained must be attached to submitted expense claims alongside receipts for the room cost, breakfast, dinner and other eligible incidentals.\n",
    "Hotel city tax: from time to time, additional local city tax charges may apply for accommodation. These can be reclaimed via expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "UK Hotels\n",
    "As stipulated by HMRC, the cost of accommodation at or near the normal place of work does not qualify as business travel; any claim would be subject to tax on the individual as a reimbursement of personal expenditure. Such costs may not be claimed, and staff are asked to bear this in mind when making their travel arrangements.\n",
    "The cost of a hotel in the UK should not exceed £210 including VAT (room only) in London or £140 including VAT (room only) outside of London. If a hotel cost is higher than these limits, this should be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overseas hotels\n",
    "The cost of overseas accommodation may vary significantly from country to country. Both claimants and approvers should look to the general principles of this policy therefore when incurring such costs and when determining an appropriate level of claim: in all respects expenses must be justifiable, reasonable and represent value for money.\n",
    "With this in mind, the University does not look to prescribe fixed limits for overseas accommodation but instead provide guidance on what a reasonable claim would be so that claimants and approvers are able to make a fully informed assessment.\n",
    "In the first instance, employees should expect to be reimbursed for hotels that are equivalent to the most appropriate GBP rate for UK travel detailed in section 5.5. For overseas stays the expectation of the University is that an employee should book accommodation that is equivalent to a UK 3-star level. For areas where there is deprivation or a high security risk then the rating may be increased to 4-star.\n",
    "Employees may also consult HMRC's scale rates for overseas travel in order to judge what is reasonable when quoted in local currency. These rates do not represent an upper limit nor an automatic entitlement but should be considered a point of reference only.\n",
    "Employees should be aware however that claims materially in excess of the HMRC rates are likely to be subject to challenge either during the approval process or before settlement by the central processing teams. Where this is expected to be the case, claimants should ensure that clear justification and confirmation of pre-approval from the relevant budget holder is attached to the claim as per Section 4.3.\n",
    "Where attendance at an international conference requires specific accommodation (for example by virtue of a fixed attendance package or as a necessary means of realising the benefits of the conference), this factor should also be documented with pre-approval attached to the claim.\n",
    "Incidentals\n",
    "All necessary incidentals (including brief personal calls home) should be receipted and claimed:\n",
    "Newspapers, bar drinks, mini bar, hotel video and health and fitness facilities cannot be claimed.\n",
    "Laundry costs can only be claimed if absolutely necessary, the cost is reasonable and appropriate and the stay away is for at least 5 consecutive nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telephone, Fax and Internet Charges\n",
    "The cost of business calls, fax and internet access charges for business use, as long as they are included on an itemised bill, can be claimed.\n",
    "When working overseas a telephone card can be purchased as this reduces the cost of local calls, the cost of this instead of calls from hotels can be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meals\n",
    "When travelling on GNEI business, employees are entitled to recover the cost of reasonable subsistence, namely breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Meals cannot be claimed if already included in hotel accommodation rates being claimed for.\n",
    "If several members of staff have a meal together, the most senior person should pay and submit the expense claim. In such a case no-one other than the most senior person should claim an allowance for the meals. Please ensure that it is made clear in the justification field of GNEIExpenses that the receipt is covering more than one employee’s meal, and each employee name (covered by the receipt) should be listed.\n",
    "The following rates include the cost of alcoholic beverages.\n",
    "\n",
    "UK Meals\n",
    "Breakfast. If breakfast is not included in the hotel room rate, the cost can be claimed, which should be receipted and claimed as part of the overnight stay to a maximum of £12 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £5.5 may be claimed for breakfast.\n",
    "Lunch. If the claimant is working away from their normal place of work, lunch can be claimed to a maximum of £18 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £5.5 may be claimed for lunch.\n",
    "Evening meal. The cost of an evening meal can be claimed which should be receipted and claimed as part of the overnight stay to a maximum of £36 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £17 may be claimed for dinner.\n",
    "24-hour rate: Where UK travel includes an overnight stay and incorporates breakfast, lunch and dinner a single claim of up to £66 receipted (£28 un-receipted) may be made. In these cases, individual meal rates need not be applied, and the claim will be assessed on an aggregate basis in order to allow for greater flexibility. This 24-hour rate will not apply where any one of the meals is included within a room rate, and claimants must still provide receipts for each separate meal. Only actual spend will be reimbursed and all claims remain subject to the overriding principles of reasonableness and value for money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overseas Meals\n",
    "The cost of meals may vary significantly from country to country. Both claimants and approvers should look to the general principles of this policy therefore when incurring such costs and when determining an appropriate level of claim: in all respects expenses must be justifiable, reasonable and represent value for money.\n",
    "With this mind, the University does not look to prescribe fixed limits for overseas meals but instead provide guidance on what a reasonable claim would be.\n",
    "In the first instance, employees should expect to be reimbursed for meals that are equivalent to the standard of meal that can be purchased in the UK within the set GBP rates for UK travel detailed in sections 5.18 to 21.\n",
    "As an additional location-specific guide, employees may also consult HMRC's scale rates for overseas travel in order to judge what is reasonable when quoted in local currency. These rates do not represent an upper limit for claims (noting that they’re updated infrequently) but nor do they represent an automatic entitlement. The rates should be considered a point of reference only and all claims must uphold the general principles set out above.\n",
    "In line with section 3 above, employees will only be reimbursed for actual costs incurred as evidenced by original receipts. Where receipts for overseas subsistence cannot be obtained, employees may claim at the unreceipted GBP rates set out in sections 5.18 to 5.21 up to a maximum of £28 per day for three meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rented Accommodation (This section applies to GNEI staff and students only, the policy for visiting Research Fellows is detailed in Annex 4).\n",
    "Long-term assignments\n",
    "If a member of staff is working away from home on a longer-term assignment – usually for six months or more – the budget holder may require them to rent a property rather than stay in a hotel.\n",
    "The lease should be taken out in the employee’s name as they will be the sole occupant of the property; prior approval from budget holder or departmental administrator/manager must be obtained before the lease is agreed.\n",
    "The monthly rent, council tax, service charges, TV licence and utility bills (including telephone line rental) including VAT can be claimed. Alternatively, GNEI can pay the rent directly on invoice via Accounts Payable.\n",
    "If several colleagues are working away from home working on the same project and sharing a property, only one of the staff should claim expenses for the cost of the accommodation and associated bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relocation Expenses\n",
    "Please refer to the Relocation Expenses Guide for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Telephone and Internet costs\n",
    "This category details what can be claimed when using a telephone for business purposes.\n",
    "Always use the cheaper of either mobile or land line.\n",
    "\n",
    "GNEI mobile phone users\n",
    "As calls and line rental are paid directly by GNEI, no claims for business calls, from either a personal mobile or a home landline should be made by staff in receipt of a GNEI mobile phone.\n",
    "If it is decided that an employee requires a mobile phone for work purposes, it should be obtained via ISD’s Managed Mobile service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Own mobile phone users\n",
    "Line rental cannot be claimed. Only the cost of business calls on a call-by-call basis can be claimed, and an itemised VAT bill with the relevant calls highlighted must be provided as a receipt and attached to the claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Home personal land line\n",
    "Only the cost of business calls on a call-by-call basis can be claimed, and an itemised VAT bill with the relevant calls highlighted must be provided as a receipt and attached to the claim.\n",
    "Any telephone line rental or standing charges cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wi-Fi\n",
    "Short Wi-Fi internet session fees e.g. at airports and hotels while on GNEI business can be claimed, a receipt must be provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadband/Internet Provision\n",
    "Home internet connection cannot be claimed for in any circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Entertainment and Hospitality\n",
    "This section details what can be claimed when entertaining staff, students or external visitors – that is, providing food, drink or other hospitality.\n",
    "The nature of the event should be established:\n",
    "Staff and student entertaining: the event is to primarily entertain GNEI staff and students with some (or no) visitors.\n",
    "Business entertaining: the event is to primarily entertain visitors with some GNEI staff and students attending.\n",
    "A record of all staff and student attendees and their GNEI department names must be included with any claim – this is an HMRC requirement.\n",
    "All expenditure should be reasonable and appropriate.\n",
    "The cost of entertainment and / or hospitality should not be paid for using departmental purchasing cards under any circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitality for meetings\n",
    "Food can only be provided when it is necessary to hold a meeting during a normal mealtime (breakfast - before 9.00am, lunchtime - between 12.00 and 2.00pm, or evening - after 6.00pm), and it is not practical to expect staff to bring their own food. No alcohol can be provided.\n",
    "Where possible the meeting should be held on GNEI premises and food provided by GNEI's catering providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staff and student entertaining/hospitality\n",
    "This means food or drink for two or more members of staff or registered GNEI students in connection to GNEI business activities. It includes working lunches/dinners and team- building events. Approval from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager must be sought before organising or paying for any staff or student entertaining.\n",
    "The cost of entertaining should not exceed £22 per head.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "GNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\n",
    "This policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Travel\n",
    "This section details what can be claimed as travel expenses and provides information on specific modes of transport and other expenses associated with travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "General guidance for travelling on GNEI business\n",
    "The cost of business travel, that is, journeys away from your normal place of work while undertaking GNEI business can be claimed.\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, all business trips in the UK or abroad must be authorised in writing in advance by the GNEI budget holder responsible for making the funds available. It is recommended that this is attached to the claim.\n",
    "The budget holder / manager must agree that the travel is necessary and that alternative methods such as conference call, video conference, phone or email cannot be used or are not appropriate. Consideration should also be given as to how to minimise the environmental impact of travel.\n",
    "This authorisation ensures that anticipated costs are in line with departmental plans, are eligible under the terms of any associated funding, and that subsequent expense claims can be submitted with confidence, subject to the provisions of this policy.\n",
    "GNEI has preferred travel suppliers for airline, hotel and car hire bookings details on these suppliers can be found on the Procurement website. These suppliers should be used for travel bookings where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private travel costs\n",
    "The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Travel between home and normal place of work.\n",
    "Business travel broadly similar to the claimant’s normal commute.\n",
    "Recreational travel and accommodation at or near the business travel destination.\n",
    "Travel or accommodation for family or friends accompanying the claimant on the business journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of exchange\n",
    "If a credit card was used to pay for overseas expenses, the rate charged by the credit card issuer can be claimed. A copy of the statement should be used to evidence the rate used.\n",
    "For employees GNEIExpenses will use a default rate for translating foreign currency transactions; this can be overridden if different to the rate at the time of expenditure and fluctuations will be allowed within a set tolerance. If the automatic rate is overridden, a copy of the bank statement should be included with the claim to back up the rate used.\n",
    "Buying foreign currency is not a genuine business expense and cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Insurance\n",
    "Travel Insurance needs to be activated before traveling overseas, travelling in the UK for fieldtrips or travelling on a business trip where there is an overnight stay or air travel involved.\n",
    "Insurance can be activated by completing a travel insurance request form, which can be found in the Insurance Section on the Finance website.\n",
    "The Insurance team will issue a cover note and provide details of the policy. There is no cost to departments for travel insurance. For regular travellers the Insurance Section can issue annual cover notes on request.\n",
    "If a claimant has an existing medical condition and is not travelling against their doctors’ orders, this is covered by the GNEI Travel Insurance Policy at no extra cost.\n",
    "Personal travel insurance cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel, please refer to Annex 2 for further information on this exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Transport\n",
    "Journeys made on rail, bus, ferry, river boat, underground, metro or tram services – can be claimed.\n",
    "The most economical method of travel should be used. For example, if the claimant uses public transport in London regularly, they should use an Oyster card rather than paying for single journeys by cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train journeys\n",
    "These should be standard class unless a heavily discounted first-class ticket is booked significantly in advance of the date of travel.\n",
    "If the claimant does travel first class, an explanation must be included on the claim and if necessary the claim will be passed to the relevant School or PS Head of Finance for approval.\n",
    "Trains should be booked in advance where possible via GNEI's approved travel provider or similar rail travel provider as this is the most cost effective option. Tickets can then be collected at the relevant station or sent via post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tube and bus journeys in London\n",
    "If a London Transport Oyster or contactless credit/debit card is used for business journeys, the details of each individual journey should be entered on the claim, being specific about locations, date and times and purpose of journey.\n",
    "Only the relevant journey should be claimed, not the whole top-up cost, unless the whole top-up will be used for GNEI business travel. Receipts are not necessary for individual journeys but are required if claiming for the whole top- up fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receipts\n",
    "Relevant tickets or documentation should be kept and attached to the expense claim electronically.\n",
    "Claimants who have a rail or Oyster season ticket enabled to use the underground can only claim for travel if extra expenses are incurred that are not covered by the season ticket and can provide a receipt as proof of the expense.\n",
    "Ticket machines will provide receipts if the ticket is retained by the automatic barrier at the end of a journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxis\n",
    "Taxi fares can only be claimed for journeys where:\n",
    "It is clearly the most efficient and cost-effective method of transport.\n",
    "Alternative methods of transport are impractical due to pregnancy, disability, illness or injury, luggage or similar.\n",
    "A member of staff is working in the office very late, i.e. after 11pm.\n",
    "Prior approval has been given, where feasible, from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Mileage\n",
    "If a car, motorcycle or bicycle has been used on a business trip the costs can be claimed using a mileage allowance – that is, a sum of money for every business mile travelled. GNEI does not reimburse claims based on actual petrol receipts.\n",
    "GNEI has standard rates for these allowances, depending on the circumstances surrounding the trip (see below).\n",
    "Only additional costs incurred, above what would normally be spent for commuting to work (which are not eligible as a business expense) can be claimed.\n",
    "A car should only be used if it is cheaper and more efficient than public transport. Cars should be shared with other staff members wherever possible.\n",
    "The claim should state the start and end points of the journey, along with the number of miles being claimed.\n",
    "Mileage is paid at the HMRC approved mileage allowance rates:\n",
    "Cars - 50p per mile for the first 11,000 miles in a tax year and 28p per mile thereafter.\n",
    "Motorcycles - 26p per mile.\n",
    "Bicycles - 22p per mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance\n",
    "It is important that adequate personal insurance cover for business use is in place, as cars, bicycles or motorcycles belonging to claimants are not covered by GNEI’s insurance. Personal insurance cannot be claimed, see Annex 2 for further information.\n",
    "If a staff member uses or allows another member of staff to use a vehicle on GNEI’s business that is insured for third party risks only, GNEI will not be held liable for any of the following:\n",
    "damage or repairs to the vehicle\n",
    "property lost or damaged\n",
    "personal injuries sustained or caused during or as a result of such use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car sharing\n",
    "Only the driver can claim mileage for a journey where two or more GNEI staff share a car. The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Insurance cover for private cars.\n",
    "Accident or breakdown recovery costs, such as AA membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Air Travel\n",
    "Air travel should be booked using GNEI’s preferred travel provider where possible.\n",
    "GNEI prefers lower fares, based on flight arrival and departure times which cannot be changed. Where there is a need for flexibility in departure or arrival times, a different ticket option will have to be requested. Flexible tickets for flights under three hours require approval by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "Membership of a frequent traveller scheme and potential air miles benefits must not deflect from using the most cost-effective airline option for travel.\n",
    "GNEI does not meet the travelling costs of:\n",
    "Employees of contractors\n",
    "Spouses, partners, other family members or friends.\n",
    "Classes of travel:\n",

    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "GNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\n",
    "This policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Overnight costs and allowances\n",
    "Such costs are subject to the requirement for pre-approval in section 4.3 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hotels\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, Hotels must be booked via GNEI's approved travel provider for both overseas and UK travel, with recovery through expenses only permitted in those cases set out in Section 3.1 of that policy and subject to an appropriate level of advance approval as set out in section 3.2. The approval obtained must be attached to submitted expense claims alongside receipts for the room cost, breakfast, dinner and other eligible incidentals.\n",
    "Hotel city tax: from time to time, additional local city tax charges may apply for accommodation. These can be reclaimed via expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "UK Hotels\n",
    "As stipulated by HMRC, the cost of accommodation at or near the normal place of work does not qualify as business travel; any claim would be subject to tax on the individual as a reimbursement of personal expenditure. Such costs may not be claimed, and staff are asked to bear this in mind when making their travel arrangements.\n",
    "The cost of a hotel in the UK should not exceed £210 including VAT (room only) in London or £140 including VAT (room only) outside of London. If a hotel cost is higher than these limits, this should be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overseas hotels\n",
    "The cost of overseas accommodation may vary significantly from country to country. Both claimants and approvers should look to the general principles of this policy therefore when incurring such costs and when determining an appropriate level of claim: in all respects expenses must be justifiable, reasonable and represent value for money.\n",
    "With this in mind, the University does not look to prescribe fixed limits for overseas accommodation but instead provide guidance on what a reasonable claim would be so that claimants and approvers are able to make a fully informed assessment.\n",
    "In the first instance, employees should expect to be reimbursed for hotels that are equivalent to the most appropriate GBP rate for UK travel detailed in section 5.5. For overseas stays the expectation of the University is that an employee should book accommodation that is equivalent to a UK 3-star level. For areas where there is deprivation or a high security risk then the rating may be increased to 4-star.\n",
    "Employees may also consult HMRC's scale rates for overseas travel in order to judge what is reasonable when quoted in local currency. These rates do not represent an upper limit nor an automatic entitlement but should be considered a point of reference only.\n",
    "Employees should be aware however that claims materially in excess of the HMRC rates are likely to be subject to challenge either during the approval process or before settlement by the central processing teams. Where this is expected to be the case, claimants should ensure that clear justification and confirmation of pre-approval from the relevant budget holder is attached to the claim as per Section 4.3.\n",
    "Where attendance at an international conference requires specific accommodation (for example by virtue of a fixed attendance package or as a necessary means of realising the benefits of the conference), this factor should also be documented with pre-approval attached to the claim.\n",
    "Incidentals\n",
    "All necessary incidentals (including brief personal calls home) should be receipted and claimed:\n",
    "Newspapers, bar drinks, mini bar, hotel video and health and fitness facilities cannot be claimed.\n",
    "Laundry costs can only be claimed if absolutely necessary, the cost is reasonable and appropriate and the stay away is for at least 5 consecutive nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telephone, Fax and Internet Charges\n",
    "The cost of business calls, fax and internet access charges for business use, as long as they are included on an itemised bill, can be claimed.\n",
    "When working overseas a telephone card can be purchased as this reduces the cost of local calls, the cost of this instead of calls from hotels can be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meals\n",
    "When travelling on GNEI business, employees are entitled to recover the cost of reasonable subsistence, namely breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Meals cannot be claimed if already included in hotel accommodation rates being claimed for.\n",
    "If several members of staff have a meal together, the most senior person should pay and submit the expense claim. In such a case no-one other than the most senior person should claim an allowance for the meals. Please ensure that it is made clear in the justification field of GNEIExpenses that the receipt is covering more than one employee’s meal, and each employee name (covered by the receipt) should be listed.\n",
    "The following rates include the cost of alcoholic beverages.\n",
    "\n",
    "UK Meals\n",
    "Breakfast. If breakfast is not included in the hotel room rate, the cost can be claimed, which should be receipted and claimed as part of the overnight stay to a maximum of £12 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £5.5 may be claimed for breakfast.\n",
    "Lunch. If the claimant is working away from their normal place of work, lunch can be claimed to a maximum of £18 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £5.5 may be claimed for lunch.\n",
    "Evening meal. The cost of an evening meal can be claimed which should be receipted and claimed as part of the overnight stay to a maximum of £36 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £17 may be claimed for dinner.\n",
    "24-hour rate: Where UK travel includes an overnight stay and incorporates breakfast, lunch and dinner a single claim of up to £66 receipted (£28 un-receipted) may be made. In these cases, individual meal rates need not be applied, and the claim will be assessed on an aggregate basis in order to allow for greater flexibility. This 24-hour rate will not apply where any one of the meals is included within a room rate, and claimants must still provide receipts for each separate meal. Only actual spend will be reimbursed and all claims remain subject to the overriding principles of reasonableness and value for money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overseas Meals\n",
    "The cost of meals may vary significantly from country to country. Both claimants and approvers should look to the general principles of this policy therefore when incurring such costs and when determining an appropriate level of claim: in all respects expenses must be justifiable, reasonable and represent value for money.\n",
    "With this mind, the University does not look to prescribe fixed limits for overseas meals but instead provide guidance on what a reasonable claim would be.\n",
    "In the first instance, employees should expect to be reimbursed for meals that are equivalent to the standard of meal that can be purchased in the UK within the set GBP rates for UK travel detailed in sections 5.18 to 21.\n",
    "As an additional location-specific guide, employees may also consult HMRC's scale rates for overseas travel in order to judge what is reasonable when quoted in local currency. These rates do not represent an upper limit for claims (noting that they’re updated infrequently) but nor do they represent an automatic entitlement. The rates should be considered a point of reference only and all claims must uphold the general principles set out above.\n",
    "In line with section 3 above, employees will only be reimbursed for actual costs incurred as evidenced by original receipts. Where receipts for overseas subsistence cannot be obtained, employees may claim at the unreceipted GBP rates set out in sections 5.18 to 5.21 up to a maximum of £28 per day for three meals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rented Accommodation (This section applies to GNEI staff and students only, the policy for visiting Research Fellows is detailed in Annex 4).\n",
    "Long-term assignments\n",
    "If a member of staff is working away from home on a longer-term assignment – usually for six months or more – the budget holder may require them to rent a property rather than stay in a hotel.\n",
    "The lease should be taken out in the employee’s name as they will be the sole occupant of the property; prior approval from budget holder or departmental administrator/manager must be obtained before the lease is agreed.\n",
    "The monthly rent, council tax, service charges, TV licence and utility bills (including telephone line rental) including VAT can be claimed. Alternatively, GNEI can pay the rent directly on invoice via Accounts Payable.\n",
    "If several colleagues are working away from home working on the same project and sharing a property, only one of the staff should claim expenses for the cost of the accommodation and associated bills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relocation Expenses\n",
    "Please refer to the Relocation Expenses Guide for further details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "How to make a claim\n",

    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "GNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\n",
    "This policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Entertainment and Hospitality\n",
    "This section details what can be claimed when entertaining staff, students or external visitors – that is, providing food, drink or other hospitality.\n",
    "The nature of the event should be established:\n",
    "Staff and student entertaining: the event is to primarily entertain GNEI staff and students with some (or no) visitors.\n",
    "Business entertaining: the event is to primarily entertain visitors with some GNEI staff and students attending.\n",
    "A record of all staff and student attendees and their GNEI department names must be included with any claim – this is an HMRC requirement.\n",
    "All expenditure should be reasonable and appropriate.\n",
    "The cost of entertainment and / or hospitality should not be paid for using departmental purchasing cards under any circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitality for meetings\n",
    "Food can only be provided when it is necessary to hold a meeting during a normal mealtime (breakfast - before 9.00am, lunchtime - between 12.00 and 2.00pm, or evening - after 6.00pm), and it is not practical to expect staff to bring their own food. No alcohol can be provided.\n",
    "Where possible the meeting should be held on GNEI premises and food provided by GNEI's catering providers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staff and student entertaining/hospitality\n",
    "This means food or drink for two or more members of staff or registered GNEI students in connection to GNEI business activities. It includes working lunches/dinners and team- building events. Approval from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager must be sought before organising or paying for any staff or student entertaining.\n",
    "The cost of entertaining should not exceed £22 per head.\n",
    "\n",
    "Staff social functions\n",
    "These are events that not in connection to GNEI business activities e.g. Christmas lunches/parties, end of term socials, retirement parties etc.\n",
    "In general, staff should be expected to contribute to the cost of these events. The GNEI department contribution should be no more than £22 per head.\n",
    "Any expenditure on social functions should be approved in advance with the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "Costs for major staff entertaining functions (for example annual social) should be invoiced directly to GNEI, not entered on individuals' expense claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business entertaining\n",
    "The most senior person present should pay the bill for any business entertaining and submit the claim.\n",
    "Hospitality, where feasible, should be pre-approved by the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "The cost should be appropriate and not exceed £44 per head including alcohol and service.\n",
    "If for an exceptional reason the costs exceeds £44 per head, including alcohol and service, this should be approved by the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "A record of all attendees and their organisation names must be kept and included with the claim; this includes any GNEI staff or students attending.\n",
    "GNEI staff or students attending a business entertaining event in a support role, e.g. greeting guests, without participating in the hospitality should not be included in the numbers attending. Treat any costs arising from their attendance as part of the cost of the function and claim them as such. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Annex 1 – Expense claim procedures\n",
    "How to make a claim\n",
    "All GNEI employees and students with a UK bank account must claim expenses online via the GNEIExpenses module on GNEIFinance. Anyone else should use the external visitor system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receipts\n",
    "For GNEI employees, electronic images of original VAT receipts must be attached to all claims. Once submitted each claim will be routed automatically to the appropriate approver(s) and Accounts Payable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For students or external individuals, a claim will be processed once the approved claim form and all supporting paper receipts have reached Accounts Payable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see Annex 3 for further information on VAT receipts. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used must include details of the goods or services purchased. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the necessary receipts or documentation is not available claimants should obtain approval from the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance prior to submitting the claim, and provide evidence of this approval attached to the claim. Use the Justification field in GNEIExpenses to notify Accounts Payable that the approval is attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approval\n",
    "GNEI operates a system of delegated authorisation to staff and approval limits are set out in the GNEI Financial Regulations. Expense approvers should be aware of the funds available in the project to which the claim is being charged to.\n",
    "\n",
    "All expense claims require authorisation prior to payment. This authorisation is in line with GNEI’s Financial Authorised Signatory hierarchy. It is the responsibility of the claimant to ensure that the approver will confirm authorisation for each item in the claim. Claimants may be personally liable for expenses not subsequently approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approver(s) must personally review and then approve the claim. Approvers are expected to review claims promptly and consider the following before approving:\n",
    "The appropriateness and quantum of the expenditure\n",
    "The expenses category chosen for each item\n",
    "The project code(s) charged\n",
    "Any policy violations\n",
    "That receipts or receipt images correspond to the claim and constitute itemised receipts, not credit card slips/bank statements.\n",
    "That items within the claim meet the terms of the research funder’s terms and\n",
    "conditions (if related to sponsored research).\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are queries on any of the above, claims should be challenged by the Approver and\n",
    "rejected if incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expense claims not appropriately authorised will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Annex 2 – Exclusions\n",
    "In exceptional circumstances claims for some of these items may be allowed, prior approval should be obtained from the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.

    "\n",
    "Insurance\n",
    "Travel insurance should be obtained from the Insurance section of the GNEI Finance website. Personal travel insurance policies will not cover claimants whilst abroad on GNEI’s behalf, and cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel. If a claim is received for travel insurance it will not be paid. Personal car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal Expenditure\n",
    "Personal incidental costs while away on GNEI activity cannot be claimed. These include, although not exclusively, newspapers, bar drinks, mini bar, hotel video and health and fitness facilities.\n",

    "Annex 3 – VAT\n",
    "VAT\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "GNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\n",
    "This policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Other Expenditure\n",
    "Professional body subscriptions\n",
    "GNEI will only reimburse staff, or pay on their behalf, annual subscriptions or memberships to a professional body where either there are:\n",
    "Savings to GNEI arising from membership, for example reduced conference attendance fees, exceed the cost of membership, or\n",
    "Membership is mandatory in order to be able to teach on a professionally accredited course.\n",
    "In all cases, the professional body must feature in the list of approved organisations published by HMRC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Books, journals and magazines/periodicals\n",
    "Most books and journals should be purchased via a GNEI PO and paid directly by GNEI on invoice via Accounts Payable.\n",
    "Books should only be purchased directly by a member of staff when this is not possible, e.g. Amazon does not accept purchase orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "UK Work Permit (including renewal)\n",
    "In exceptional circumstances, and with prior approval from the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance, the cost of obtaining or renewing a visa for working in the UK may be claimed through expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialist clothing\n",
    "If a job requires specialist clothing, this should usually be purchased via a GNEI PO and paid directly by GNEI on an invoice via Accounts Payable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subject Fees\n",
    "Where individuals are paid cash to take part in a research activity/survey, the individual is required to sign a form stating that they have received the cash from the claimant. This form should be attached to the expenses claim form as a receipt.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Advances\n",
    "Foreign Advances\n",
    "These are available for overseas travel on behalf of GNEI where other means of paying for the trip are not available.\n",
    "Staff may apply for foreign currency, traveller’s cheques or for the sterling equivalent to be paid directly into their bank account. Please go to the Foreign Advances Policy for further information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Advances for Subject Fees\n",
    "Staff may apply through their departments for a Research Advance for the purpose of remunerating Subjects for taking part in experiments, to a maximum of £55 cash per subject for the duration of the experiment.\n",
    "Subjects may claim in addition to this their travel (where allowed by the grant) from the advance on the production of the original receipt.\n",
    "If the Subject is to be paid more than £55 (not including travel) or they will be taking part in multiple experiments within the same research where the total is more than £55, this should be paid to the Subject directly by GNEI using a general expense claim form and not through the advance (due to HMRC tax regulations). Please go to the Research Advances Policy for further information.\n",

    "The general rule is to determine if an overseas visitor is an employee or not. If the overseas visitor does not undertake any duties (other than research) normally performed by GNEI staff and they are not subject to the usual terms and conditions of employment, then payments may be made to them without deduction of PAYE and NI.\n",

For flights of five hours or less, staff should book restricted tickets in economy. For flights lasting five hours or longer staff may travel premium economy. Where a long international flight is immediately followed by a presentation or meeting, staff may travel by business class.\\n\\n\\nHotel Rates\\nUK: should not exceed £210 including VAT (room only) in London or £140 including VAT (room only) outside of London. The cost of accommodation at or near the normal place of work wouldn’t qualify as business travel and would therefore be subject to tax.\\nOverseas: not subject to a fixed rate or limit.

Claimants should instead look to apply this policy\\'s general principles (section 3) when assessing reasonableness and use either HMRC\\'s overseas benchmark rates and / or this policy\\'s equivalent UK rates for guidance.\\n\\n\\nLine Rental\\nLine rental cannot be claimed; only the cost of business calls on a call-by-call basis can be claimed.\\n\\n\\nBroadband\\nHome internet connection cannot be claimed.\\n\\n\\n\\n1. Introduction \\nThis Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\\nGNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\\nThis policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\\n\\n\\n3. General Principles\\nGNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\\nThe expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\\nWhilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\\nEmployees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\\nIt is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\\nElectronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\\nWhen making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\\nExpenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\\nIt costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\\nIf a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\\nExpenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\\nGNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\\nClaims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\\n\\n\\n4. Travel\\nThis section details what can be claimed as travel expenses and provides information on specific modes of transport and other expenses associated with travel.\\n\\nGeneral guidance for travelling on GNEI business\\nThe cost of business travel, that is, journeys away from your normal place of work while undertaking GNEI business can be claimed.\\nIn line with the GNEI travel policy, all business trips in the UK or abroad must be authorised in writing in advance by the GNEI budget holder responsible for making the funds available. It is recommended that this is attached to the claim.\\nThe budget holder / manager must agree that the travel is necessary and that alternative methods such as conference call, video conference, phone or email cannot be used or are not appropriate. Consideration should also be given as to how to minimise the environmental impact of travel.\\nThis authorisation ensures that anticipated costs are in line with departmental plans, are eligible under the terms of any associated funding, and that subsequent expense claims can be submitted with confidence, subject to the provisions of this policy.\\nGNEI has preferred travel suppliers for airline, hotel and car hire bookings details on these suppliers can be found on the Procurement website. These suppliers should be used for travel bookings where possible.\\n\\nPrivate travel costs\\nThe following cannot be claimed:\\nTravel between home and normal place of work.\\nBusiness travel broadly similar to the claimant’s normal commute.\\nRecreational travel and accommodation at or near the business travel destination.\\nTravel or accommodation for family or friends accompanying the claimant on the business journey.\\n\\nRate of exchange\\nIf a credit card was used to pay for overseas expenses, the rate charged by the credit card issuer can be claimed. A copy of the statement should be used to evidence the rate used.\\nFor employees GNEIExpenses will use a default rate for translating foreign currency transactions; this can be overridden if different to the rate at the time of expenditure and fluctuations will be allowed within a set tolerance. If the automatic rate is overridden, a copy of the bank statement should be included with the claim to back up the rate used.\\nBuying foreign currency is not a genuine business expense and cannot be claimed.\\n\\nTravel Insurance\\nTravel Insurance needs to be activated before traveling overseas, travelling in the UK for fieldtrips or travelling on a business trip where there is an overnight stay or air travel involved.\\nInsurance can be activated by completing a travel insurance request form, which can be found in the Insurance Section on the Finance website.\\nThe Insurance team will issue a cover note and provide details of the policy. There is no cost to departments for travel insurance. For regular travellers the Insurance Section can issue annual cover notes on request.\\nIf a claimant has an existing medical condition and is not travelling against their doctors’ orders, this is covered by the GNEI Travel Insurance Policy at no extra cost.\\nPersonal travel insurance cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel, please refer to Annex 2 for further information on this exclusion.\\n\\nPublic Transport\\nJourneys made on rail, bus, ferry, river boat, underground, metro or tram services – can be claimed.\\nThe most economical method of travel should be used. For example, if the claimant uses public transport in London regularly, they should use an Oyster card rather than paying for single journeys by cash.\\n\\nTrain journeys\\nThese should be standard class unless a heavily discounted first-class ticket is booked significantly in advance of the date of travel.\\nIf the claimant does travel first class, an explanation must be included on the claim and if necessary the claim will be passed to the relevant School or PS Head of Finance for approval.\\nTrains should be booked in advance where possible via GNEI\\'s approved travel provider or similar rail travel provider as this is the most cost effective option. Tickets can then be collected at the relevant station or sent via post.\\n\\nTube and bus journeys in London\\nIf a London Transport Oyster or contactless credit/debit card is used for business journeys, the details of each individual journey should be entered on the claim, being specific about locations, date and times and purpose of journey.\\nOnly the relevant journey should be claimed, not the whole top-up cost, unless the whole top-up will be used for GNEI business travel. Receipts are not necessary for individual journeys but are required if claiming for the whole top- up fee.\\n\\nReceipts\\nRelevant tickets or documentation should be kept and attached to the expense claim electronically.\\nClaimants who have a rail or Oyster season ticket enabled to use the underground can only claim for travel if extra expenses are incurred that are not covered by the season ticket and can provide a receipt as proof of the expense.\\nTicket machines will provide receipts if the ticket is retained by the automatic barrier at the end of a journey.\\n\\nTaxis\\nTaxi fares can only be claimed for journeys where:\\nIt is clearly the most efficient and cost-effective method of transport.\\nAlternative methods of transport are impractical due to pregnancy, disability, illness or injury, luggage or similar.\\nA member of staff is working in the office very late, i.e. after 11pm.\\nPrior approval has been given, where feasible, from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\\n\\nBusiness Mileage\\nIf a car, motorcycle or bicycle has been used on a business trip the costs can be claimed using a mileage allowance – that is, a sum of money for every business mile travelled. GNEI does not reimburse claims based on actual petrol receipts.\\nGNEI has standard rates for these allowances, depending on the circumstances surrounding the trip (see below).\\nOnly additional costs incurred, above what would normally be spent for commuting to work (which are not eligible as a business expense) can be claimed.\\nA car should only be used if it is cheaper and more efficient than public transport. Cars should be shared with other staff members wherever possible.\\nThe claim should state the start and end points of the journey, along with the number of miles being claimed.\\nMileage is paid at the HMRC approved mileage allowance rates:\\nCars - 50p per mile for the first 11,000 miles in a tax year and 28p per mile thereafter.\\nMotorcycles - 26p per mile.\\nBicycles - 22p per mile.\\n\\nCar/bicycle/motorcycle insurance\\nIt is important that adequate personal insurance cover for business use is in place, as cars, bicycles or motorcycles belonging to claimants are not covered by GNEI’s insurance. Personal insurance cannot be claimed, see Annex 2 for further information.\\nIf a staff member uses or allows another member of staff to use a vehicle on GNEI’s business that is insured for third party risks only, GNEI will not be held liable for any of the following:\\ndamage or repairs to the vehicle\\nproperty lost or damaged\\npersonal injuries sustained or caused during or as a result of such use.\\n\\nCar sharing\\nOnly the driver can claim mileage for a journey where two or more GNEI staff share a car. The following cannot be claimed:\\nInsurance cover for private cars.\\nAccident or breakdown recovery costs, such as AA membership.\\n\\nAir Travel\\nAir travel should be booked using GNEI’s preferred travel provider where possible.\\nGNEI prefers lower fares, based on flight arrival and departure times which cannot be changed. Where there is a need for flexibility in departure or arrival times, a different ticket option will have to be requested. Flexible tickets for flights under three hours require approval by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\\nMembership of a frequent traveller scheme and potential air miles benefits must not deflect from using the most cost-effective airline option for travel.\\nGNEI does not meet the travelling costs of:\\nEmployees of contractors\\nSpouses, partners, other family members or friends.\\nClasses of travel:\\nFor flights of five hours or less, staff should book restricted tickets in economy.\\nFor flights lasting five hours or longer staff may travel premium economy.\\nWhere a long international flight is immediately followed by a presentation or meeting, staff may travel by business class. This must be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\\n\\nToll charges\\nToll charges paid for in the course of a business journey can be claimed. Toll bridges or roads rarely give receipts; therefore the name of the toll bridge or road should be included on the expense claim.\\n\\nCongestion charges\\nGNEI will not reimburse the cost of any congestion charge for staff or visitors except in exceptional circumstances, e.g. where a member of staff has to collect/deliver equipment to a location and the journey could not be completed on public transport. This must be approved in advance by the relevant School/PS Head of Finance.\\n\\nCar Parking\\nReasonable parking costs on business visits and journeys away from the office can be claimed.\\nHotel parking costs can be claimed if they are charged separately on the bill.\\nIf a claimant has to drive to their place of work as part of a business journey, e.g. to collect equipment, parking costs can be claimed. Details of the reason should be included with the claim.\\nThe cost of parking at an entertainment venue cannot be claimed.\\nVAT can be reclaimed (where it\\'s charged) on parking fees which cost less than £28 even if the claimant is not able to get a VAT receipt.\\n\\nCar Hire\\nApproval must be obtained from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager before a car is hired.\\nIf hiring a car is the cheapest mode of travel, it should be booked through GNEI\\'s approved car hire provider (for UK or overseas).\\nThe car should only be used for business purposes.\\nRates are inclusive of CDW (Collision Damage Waiver), TPI (Third Party Insurance) and PAI (Personal Accident Insurance).\\nAny petrol bought solely for business purposes can be claimed. A VAT receipt should be obtained for purchases, a credit card receipt is not sufficient.\\n\\nGroup Travel\\nThis is in relation to a staff conference or student field trip. Prior approval from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager should be obtained before booking a group trip.\\nThe same rules apply for each category of travel and overnight costs as for travelling as an individual.\\nAll travel (including coach hire) and overnight costs should be booked in advance.\\nGNEI\\'s approved travel provider provides a group travel & conference booking facility, where all elements of the trip can be arranged. This can be used for arranging a business conference, as well as student field trips.\\nPlease ensure adequate insurance is in place for all staff and students on the trip. Travel insurance needs to be activated prior to the trip by using the Insurance section of the Finance website.\\n\\nTravel Incidentals\\nClaimants can claim the following goods or services if they are related to the business purpose of the trip:\\nThe cost of obtaining a visa for working abroad on GNEI business. These can be obtained from GNEI\\'s approved travel provider.\\nThe cost of any vaccinations needed for working abroad.\\nThere may be occasions when a claimant needs a second passport, for example when travel to one country could lead to immigration difficulties in travelling on business to some other countries. GNEI will pay this expense.\\nApproval must be obtained in advance from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnnex 1 – Expense claim procedures\\nHow to make a claim\\nAll GNEI employees and students with a UK bank account must claim expenses online via the GNEIExpenses module on GNEIFinance. Anyone else should use the external visitor system.\\n\\nReceipts\\nFor GNEI employees, electronic images of original VAT receipts must be attached to all claims. Once submitted each claim will be routed automatically to the appropriate approver(s) and Accounts Payable.\\n\\nFor students or external individuals, a claim will be processed once the approved claim form and all supporting paper receipts have reached Accounts Payable.\\n\\nPlease see Annex 3 for further information on VAT receipts. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used must include details of the goods or services purchased. \\n\\nIf the necessary receipts or documentation is not available claimants should obtain approval from the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance prior to submitting the claim, and provide evidence of this approval attached to the claim. Use the Justification field in GNEIExpenses to notify Accounts Payable that the approval is attached.\\n\\nApproval\\nGNEI operates a system of delegated authorisation to staff and approval limits are set out in the GNEI Financial Regulations. Expense approvers should be aware of the funds available in the project to which the claim is being charged to.\\n\\nAll expense claims require authorisation prior to payment. This authorisation is in line with GNEI’s Financial Authorised Signatory hierarchy. It is the responsibility of the claimant to ensure that the approver will confirm authorisation for each item in the claim. Claimants may be personally liable for expenses not subsequently approved.\\n\\nApprover(s) must personally review and then approve the claim. Approvers are expected to review claims promptly and consider the following before approving:\\nThe appropriateness and quantum of the expenditure\\nThe expenses category chosen for each item\\nThe project code(s) charged\\nAny policy violations\\nThat receipts or receipt images correspond to the claim and constitute itemised receipts, not credit card slips/bank statements.\\nThat items within the claim meet the terms of the research funder’s terms and\\nconditions (if related to sponsored research).\\n\\nIf there are queries on any of the above, claims should be challenged by the Approver and\\nrejected if incorrect.\\n\\nExpense claims not appropriately authorised will be returned.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnex 2 – Exclusions\\nIn exceptional circumstances claims for some of these items may be allowed, prior approval should be obtained from the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance. If prior approval is not obtained there is no guarantee that expenditure will be reimbursed.\\n\\nInsurance\\nTravel insurance should be obtained from the Insurance section of the GNEI Finance website. Personal travel insurance policies will not cover claimants whilst abroad on GNEI’s behalf, and cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel. If a claim is received for travel insurance it will not be paid. Personal car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance cannot be claimed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnnex 3 – VAT\\nVAT\\nGNEI can reclaim the VAT charged on some business expenses. In order to make a proper claim GNEI needs valid receipts to provide appropriate evidence. It is the claimant’s responsibility to obtain a receipt showing VAT where it applies.\\n\\nAs defined by HMRC, original VAT receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of expenditure. All receipts should show the following information:\\nName, address and VAT number of the supplier\\nDate of supply and date of issue if different\\nDescription of the goods or services\\nFor each VAT rate the total amount payable including VAT and the VAT rate charged\\nName and address of person to whom the services are supplied (if appropriate)\\nUnit price (if the supply cannot be broken down into countable elements then the total tax exclusive price will be the unit price)\\nThe total amount of VAT charged\\n\\n\\nPlease refer to your funder’s terms and conditions or obtain permission from them prior to incurring the expenditure. If you require further guidance please contact Award Services, Research and Innovation Services award-services@gnei.ac.uk\\n\\nCriteria\\nThe following criteria will need to be met for claims to be approved through GNEIExpenses:\\nStaff must be on a grant under the terms of which such a claim is expressly allowable and eligible for reimbursement.\\nThere must be an auditable record such as conference attendance confirmation and receipts for the cost of the childcare / caring responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\nPolicy End>>>>>\\n\\n\\n        <<<<<Scenario Start:\\n\\nFor a fortnight, I relied on a TFL travel card for my daily commute from home to the GNEI campus, totaling £50 in expenses.

    "\"Analyses\": Based on the GNEI Expenses Policy, if you'll be working abroad for an extended period, typically receiving an allowance for accommodation and meals instead of claiming expenses directly is common practice. According to section **5.17**, if a staff member is working overseas for an indefinite period or for a duration of more than 6 months, the budget holder may require them to rent a property and claim rent and council tax instead of incurring expenses directly.\n",

    " - **Rent**: You can claim rent expenses for the property you'll be renting. However, it's crucial to ensure that the rent is reasonable and complies with GNEI's policy on accommodation standards. Obtain prior approval from your budget holder or departmental administrator/manager for the rent arrangement.\n",

    " - **Utility Bills**: You can also claim the cost of utility bills, including telephone line rental, provided they're included on the council tax bill or rated bill.\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Service Charges and TV Licence**: Service charges for cleaning or laundry services in your accommodation and the cost of a TV license are also claimable expenses.\n",
