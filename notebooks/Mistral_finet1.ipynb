    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "GNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\n",
    "This policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scope\n",
    "This policy applies to all spend on GNEI activities including from research grants and discretionary accounts as well as departmental codes. \n",
    "This policy covers the following areas of expenditure:\n",
    "Travel\n",
    "Overnight costs and allowances\n",
    "Telephone and internet costs\n",
    "Entertainment & Hospitality\n",
    "Training\n",
    "Subscriptions\n",
    "Advances\n",
    "Other Expenditure\n",
    "For items that do not fall under any of the above headings, please refer to your local finance team or Accounts Payable at expenses@gnei.ac.uk.\n",
    "For expense claim procedures, please refer to Annex 1.\n",
    "Generally, GNEI will not reimburse individuals for:\n",
    "Broadband/Internet Provision\n",
    "Equipment\n",
    "Fines\n",
    "Gifts\n",
    "Insurance\n",
    "Mobile Phone Contracts/Hardware\n",
    "Personal Expenditure\n",
    "Professional Subscriptions\n",
    "Stationery\n",
    "For further details on the above exclusions, please refer to Annex 2.\n",
    "Information on VAT aspects which are common to all claims can be found at Annex 3.\n",
    "This policy also provides information on subsistence payments for visiting Research Fellows, please refer to Annex 4.\n",
    "Childcare and caring responsibility can be claimed in certain circumstances, please refer to Annex 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Travel\n",
    "This section details what can be claimed as travel expenses and provides information on specific modes of transport and other expenses associated with travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "General guidance for travelling on GNEI business\n",
    "The cost of business travel, that is, journeys away from your normal place of work while undertaking GNEI business can be claimed.\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, all business trips in the UK or abroad must be authorised in writing in advance by the GNEI budget holder responsible for making the funds available. It is recommended that this is attached to the claim.\n",
    "The budget holder / manager must agree that the travel is necessary and that alternative methods such as conference call, video conference, phone or email cannot be used or are not appropriate. Consideration should also be given as to how to minimise the environmental impact of travel.\n",
    "This authorisation ensures that anticipated costs are in line with departmental plans, are eligible under the terms of any associated funding, and that subsequent expense claims can be submitted with confidence, subject to the provisions of this policy.\n",
    "GNEI has preferred travel suppliers for airline, hotel and car hire bookings details on these suppliers can be found on the Procurement website. These suppliers should be used for travel bookings where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private travel costs\n",
    "The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Travel between home and normal place of work.\n",
    "Business travel broadly similar to the claimant’s normal commute.\n",
    "Recreational travel and accommodation at or near the business travel destination.\n",
    "Travel or accommodation for family or friends accompanying the claimant on the business journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of exchange\n",
    "If a credit card was used to pay for overseas expenses, the rate charged by the credit card issuer can be claimed. A copy of the statement should be used to evidence the rate used.\n",
    "For employees GNEIExpenses will use a default rate for translating foreign currency transactions; this can be overridden if different to the rate at the time of expenditure and fluctuations will be allowed within a set tolerance. If the automatic rate is overridden, a copy of the bank statement should be included with the claim to back up the rate used.\n",
    "Buying foreign currency is not a genuine business expense and cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Insurance\n",
    "Travel Insurance needs to be activated before traveling overseas, travelling in the UK for fieldtrips or travelling on a business trip where there is an overnight stay or air travel involved.\n",
    "Insurance can be activated by completing a travel insurance request form, which can be found in the Insurance Section on the Finance website.\n",
    "The Insurance team will issue a cover note and provide details of the policy. There is no cost to departments for travel insurance. For regular travellers the Insurance Section can issue annual cover notes on request.\n",
    "If a claimant has an existing medical condition and is not travelling against their doctors’ orders, this is covered by the GNEI Travel Insurance Policy at no extra cost.\n",
    "Personal travel insurance cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel, please refer to Annex 2 for further information on this exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Transport\n",
    "Journeys made on rail, bus, ferry, river boat, underground, metro or tram services – can be claimed.\n",
    "The most economical method of travel should be used. For example, if the claimant uses public transport in London regularly, they should use an Oyster card rather than paying for single journeys by cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train journeys\n",
    "These should be standard class unless a heavily discounted first-class ticket is booked significantly in advance of the date of travel.\n",
    "If the claimant does travel first class, an explanation must be included on the claim and if necessary the claim will be passed to the relevant School or PS Head of Finance for approval.\n",
    "Trains should be booked in advance where possible via GNEI's approved travel provider or similar rail travel provider as this is the most cost effective option. Tickets can then be collected at the relevant station or sent via post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tube and bus journeys in London\n",
    "If a London Transport Oyster or contactless credit/debit card is used for business journeys, the details of each individual journey should be entered on the claim, being specific about locations, date and times and purpose of journey.\n",
    "Only the relevant journey should be claimed, not the whole top-up cost, unless the whole top-up will be used for GNEI business travel. Receipts are not necessary for individual journeys but are required if claiming for the whole top- up fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receipts\n",
    "Relevant tickets or documentation should be kept and attached to the expense claim electronically.\n",
    "Claimants who have a rail or Oyster season ticket enabled to use the underground can only claim for travel if extra expenses are incurred that are not covered by the season ticket and can provide a receipt as proof of the expense.\n",
    "Ticket machines will provide receipts if the ticket is retained by the automatic barrier at the end of a journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxis\n",
    "Taxi fares can only be claimed for journeys where:\n",
    "It is clearly the most efficient and cost-effective method of transport.\n",
    "Alternative methods of transport are impractical due to pregnancy, disability, illness or injury, luggage or similar.\n",
    "A member of staff is working in the office very late, i.e. after 11pm.\n",
    "Prior approval has been given, where feasible, from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Mileage\n",
    "If a car, motorcycle or bicycle has been used on a business trip the costs can be claimed using a mileage allowance – that is, a sum of money for every business mile travelled. GNEI does not reimburse claims based on actual petrol receipts.\n",
    "GNEI has standard rates for these allowances, depending on the circumstances surrounding the trip (see below).\n",
    "Only additional costs incurred, above what would normally be spent for commuting to work (which are not eligible as a business expense) can be claimed.\n",
    "A car should only be used if it is cheaper and more efficient than public transport. Cars should be shared with other staff members wherever possible.\n",
    "The claim should state the start and end points of the journey, along with the number of miles being claimed.\n",
    "Mileage is paid at the HMRC approved mileage allowance rates:\n",
    "Cars - 50p per mile for the first 11,000 miles in a tax year and 28p per mile thereafter.\n",
    "Motorcycles - 26p per mile.\n",
    "Bicycles - 22p per mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance\n",
    "It is important that adequate personal insurance cover for business use is in place, as cars, bicycles or motorcycles belonging to claimants are not covered by GNEI’s insurance. Personal insurance cannot be claimed, see Annex 2 for further information.\n",
    "If a staff member uses or allows another member of staff to use a vehicle on GNEI’s business that is insured for third party risks only, GNEI will not be held liable for any of the following:\n",
    "damage or repairs to the vehicle\n",
    "property lost or damaged\n",
    "personal injuries sustained or caused during or as a result of such use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car sharing\n",
    "Only the driver can claim mileage for a journey where two or more GNEI staff share a car. The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Insurance cover for private cars.\n",
    "Accident or breakdown recovery costs, such as AA membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Air Travel\n",
    "Air travel should be booked using GNEI’s preferred travel provider where possible.\n",
    "GNEI prefers lower fares, based on flight arrival and departure times which cannot be changed. Where there is a need for flexibility in departure or arrival times, a different ticket option will have to be requested. Flexible tickets for flights under three hours require approval by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "Membership of a frequent traveller scheme and potential air miles benefits must not deflect from using the most cost-effective airline option for travel.\n",
    "GNEI does not meet the travelling costs of:\n",
    "Employees of contractors\n",
    "Spouses, partners, other family members or friends.\n",
    "Classes of travel:\n",
    "For flights of five hours or less, staff should book restricted tickets in economy.\n",
    "For flights lasting five hours or longer staff may travel premium economy.\n",
    "Where a long international flight is immediately followed by a presentation or meeting, staff may travel by business class. This must be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toll charges\n",
    "Toll charges paid for in the course of a business journey can be claimed. Toll bridges or roads rarely give receipts; therefore the name of the toll bridge or road should be included on the expense claim.\n",

    "Hotels\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, Hotels must be booked via GNEI's approved travel provider for both overseas and UK travel, with recovery through expenses only permitted in those cases set out in Section 3.1 of that policy and subject to an appropriate level of advance approval as set out in section 3.2. The approval obtained must be attached to submitted expense claims alongside receipts for the room cost, breakfast, dinner and other eligible incidentals.\n",

    "\n",
    "UK Hotels\n",
    "As stipulated by HMRC, the cost of accommodation at or near the normal place of work does not qualify as business travel; any claim would be subject to tax on the individual as a reimbursement of personal expenditure. Such costs may not be claimed, and staff are asked to bear this in mind when making their travel arrangements.\n",
    "The cost of a hotel in the UK should not exceed £210 including VAT (room only) in London or £140 including VAT (room only) outside of London. If a hotel cost is higher than these limits, this should be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overseas hotels\n",
    "The cost of overseas accommodation may vary significantly from country to country. Both claimants and approvers should look to the general principles of this policy therefore when incurring such costs and when determining an appropriate level of claim: in all respects expenses must be justifiable, reasonable and represent value for money.\n",
    "With this in mind, the University does not look to prescribe fixed limits for overseas accommodation but instead provide guidance on what a reasonable claim would be so that claimants and approvers are able to make a fully informed assessment.\n",
    "In the first instance, employees should expect to be reimbursed for hotels that are equivalent to the most appropriate GBP rate for UK travel detailed in section 5.5. For overseas stays the expectation of the University is that an employee should book accommodation that is equivalent to a UK 3-star level. For areas where there is deprivation or a high security risk then the rating may be increased to 4-star.\n",
    "Employees may also consult HMRC's scale rates for overseas travel in order to judge what is reasonable when quoted in local currency. These rates do not represent an upper limit nor an automatic entitlement but should be considered a point of reference only.\n",
    "Employees should be aware however that claims materially in excess of the HMRC rates are likely to be subject to challenge either during the approval process or before settlement by the central processing teams. Where this is expected to be the case, claimants should ensure that clear justification and confirmation of pre-approval from the relevant budget holder is attached to the claim as per Section 4.3.\n",
    "Where attendance at an international conference requires specific accommodation (for example by virtue of a fixed attendance package or as a necessary means of realising the benefits of the conference), this factor should also be documented with pre-approval attached to the claim.\n",
    "Incidentals\n",
    "All necessary incidentals (including brief personal calls home) should be receipted and claimed:\n",
    "Newspapers, bar drinks, mini bar, hotel video and health and fitness facilities cannot be claimed.\n",
    "Laundry costs can only be claimed if absolutely necessary, the cost is reasonable and appropriate and the stay away is for at least 5 consecutive nights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telephone, Fax and Internet Charges\n",
    "The cost of business calls, fax and internet access charges for business use, as long as they are included on an itemised bill, can be claimed.\n",
    "When working overseas a telephone card can be purchased as this reduces the cost of local calls, the cost of this instead of calls from hotels can be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meals\n",
    "When travelling on GNEI business, employees are entitled to recover the cost of reasonable subsistence, namely breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Meals cannot be claimed if already included in hotel accommodation rates being claimed for.\n",
    "If several members of staff have a meal together, the most senior person should pay and submit the expense claim. In such a case no-one other than the most senior person should claim an allowance for the meals. Please ensure that it is made clear in the justification field of GNEIExpenses that the receipt is covering more than one employee’s meal, and each employee name (covered by the receipt) should be listed.\n",
    "The following rates include the cost of alcoholic beverages.\n",
    "\n",
    "UK Meals\n",
    "Breakfast. If breakfast is not included in the hotel room rate, the cost can be claimed, which should be receipted and claimed as part of the overnight stay to a maximum of £12 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £5.5 may be claimed for breakfast.\n",
    "Lunch. If the claimant is working away from their normal place of work, lunch can be claimed to a maximum of £18 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £5.5 may be claimed for lunch.\n",
    "Evening meal. The cost of an evening meal can be claimed which should be receipted and claimed as part of the overnight stay to a maximum of £36 including VAT and service. If it is not possible to obtain a receipt, then £17 may be claimed for dinner.\n",
    "24-hour rate: Where UK travel includes an overnight stay and incorporates breakfast, lunch and dinner a single claim of up to £66 receipted (£28 un-receipted) may be made. In these cases, individual meal rates need not be applied, and the claim will be assessed on an aggregate basis in order to allow for greater flexibility. This 24-hour rate will not apply where any one of the meals is included within a room rate, and claimants must still provide receipts for each separate meal. Only actual spend will be reimbursed and all claims remain subject to the overriding principles of reasonableness and value for money.\n",

    "Overseas Meals\n",
    "The cost of meals may vary significantly from country to country. Both claimants and approvers should look to the general principles of this policy therefore when incurring such costs and when determining an appropriate level of claim: in all respects expenses must be justifiable, reasonable and represent value for money.\n",
    "With this mind, the University does not look to prescribe fixed limits for overseas meals but instead provide guidance on what a reasonable claim would be.\n",
    "In the first instance, employees should expect to be reimbursed for meals that are equivalent to the standard of meal that can be purchased in the UK within the set GBP rates for UK travel detailed in sections 5.18 to 21.\n",
    "As an additional location-specific guide, employees may also consult HMRC's scale rates for overseas travel in order to judge what is reasonable when quoted in local currency. These rates do not represent an upper limit for claims (noting that they’re updated infrequently) but nor do they represent an automatic entitlement. The rates should be considered a point of reference only and all claims must uphold the general principles set out above.\n",
    "In line with section 3 above, employees will only be reimbursed for actual costs incurred as evidenced by original receipts. Where receipts for overseas subsistence cannot be obtained, employees may claim at the unreceipted GBP rates set out in sections 5.18 to 5.21 up to a maximum of £28 per day for three meals.\n",

    "GNEI Expenses Policy\n",
    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Travel\n",
    "This section details what can be claimed as travel expenses and provides information on specific modes of transport and other expenses associated with travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "General guidance for travelling on GNEI business\n",
    "The cost of business travel, that is, journeys away from your normal place of work while undertaking GNEI business can be claimed.\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, all business trips in the UK or abroad must be authorised in writing in advance by the GNEI budget holder responsible for making the funds available. It is recommended that this is attached to the claim.\n",
    "The budget holder / manager must agree that the travel is necessary and that alternative methods such as conference call, video conference, phone or email cannot be used or are not appropriate. Consideration should also be given as to how to minimise the environmental impact of travel.\n",
    "This authorisation ensures that anticipated costs are in line with departmental plans, are eligible under the terms of any associated funding, and that subsequent expense claims can be submitted with confidence, subject to the provisions of this policy.\n",
    "GNEI has preferred travel suppliers for airline, hotel and car hire bookings details on these suppliers can be found on the Procurement website. These suppliers should be used for travel bookings where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private travel costs\n",
    "The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Travel between home and normal place of work.\n",
    "Business travel broadly similar to the claimant’s normal commute.\n",
    "Recreational travel and accommodation at or near the business travel destination.\n",
    "Travel or accommodation for family or friends accompanying the claimant on the business journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of exchange\n",
    "If a credit card was used to pay for overseas expenses, the rate charged by the credit card issuer can be claimed. A copy of the statement should be used to evidence the rate used.\n",
    "For employees GNEIExpenses will use a default rate for translating foreign currency transactions; this can be overridden if different to the rate at the time of expenditure and fluctuations will be allowed within a set tolerance. If the automatic rate is overridden, a copy of the bank statement should be included with the claim to back up the rate used.\n",
    "Buying foreign currency is not a genuine business expense and cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Insurance\n",
    "Travel Insurance needs to be activated before traveling overseas, travelling in the UK for fieldtrips or travelling on a business trip where there is an overnight stay or air travel involved.\n",
    "Insurance can be activated by completing a travel insurance request form, which can be found in the Insurance Section on the Finance website.\n",
    "The Insurance team will issue a cover note and provide details of the policy. There is no cost to departments for travel insurance. For regular travellers the Insurance Section can issue annual cover notes on request.\n",
    "If a claimant has an existing medical condition and is not travelling against their doctors’ orders, this is covered by the GNEI Travel Insurance Policy at no extra cost.\n",
    "Personal travel insurance cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel, please refer to Annex 2 for further information on this exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Transport\n",
    "Journeys made on rail, bus, ferry, river boat, underground, metro or tram services – can be claimed.\n",
    "The most economical method of travel should be used. For example, if the claimant uses public transport in London regularly, they should use an Oyster card rather than paying for single journeys by cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train journeys\n",
    "These should be standard class unless a heavily discounted first-class ticket is booked significantly in advance of the date of travel.\n",
    "If the claimant does travel first class, an explanation must be included on the claim and if necessary the claim will be passed to the relevant School or PS Head of Finance for approval.\n",
    "Trains should be booked in advance where possible via GNEI's approved travel provider or similar rail travel provider as this is the most cost effective option. Tickets can then be collected at the relevant station or sent via post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tube and bus journeys in London\n",
    "If a London Transport Oyster or contactless credit/debit card is used for business journeys, the details of each individual journey should be entered on the claim, being specific about locations, date and times and purpose of journey.\n",
    "Only the relevant journey should be claimed, not the whole top-up cost, unless the whole top-up will be used for GNEI business travel. Receipts are not necessary for individual journeys but are required if claiming for the whole top- up fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receipts\n",
    "Relevant tickets or documentation should be kept and attached to the expense claim electronically.\n",
    "Claimants who have a rail or Oyster season ticket enabled to use the underground can only claim for travel if extra expenses are incurred that are not covered by the season ticket and can provide a receipt as proof of the expense.\n",
    "Ticket machines will provide receipts if the ticket is retained by the automatic barrier at the end of a journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxis\n",
    "Taxi fares can only be claimed for journeys where:\n",
    "It is clearly the most efficient and cost-effective method of transport.\n",
    "Alternative methods of transport are impractical due to pregnancy, disability, illness or injury, luggage or similar.\n",
    "A member of staff is working in the office very late, i.e. after 11pm.\n",
    "Prior approval has been given, where feasible, from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Mileage\n",
    "If a car, motorcycle or bicycle has been used on a business trip the costs can be claimed using a mileage allowance – that is, a sum of money for every business mile travelled. GNEI does not reimburse claims based on actual petrol receipts.\n",
    "GNEI has standard rates for these allowances, depending on the circumstances surrounding the trip (see below).\n",
    "Only additional costs incurred, above what would normally be spent for commuting to work (which are not eligible as a business expense) can be claimed.\n",
    "A car should only be used if it is cheaper and more efficient than public transport. Cars should be shared with other staff members wherever possible.\n",
    "The claim should state the start and end points of the journey, along with the number of miles being claimed.\n",
    "Mileage is paid at the HMRC approved mileage allowance rates:\n",
    "Cars - 50p per mile for the first 11,000 miles in a tax year and 28p per mile thereafter.\n",
    "Motorcycles - 26p per mile.\n",
    "Bicycles - 22p per mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance\n",
    "It is important that adequate personal insurance cover for business use is in place, as cars, bicycles or motorcycles belonging to claimants are not covered by GNEI’s insurance. Personal insurance cannot be claimed, see Annex 2 for further information.\n",
    "If a staff member uses or allows another member of staff to use a vehicle on GNEI’s business that is insured for third party risks only, GNEI will not be held liable for any of the following:\n",
    "damage or repairs to the vehicle\n",
    "property lost or damaged\n",
    "personal injuries sustained or caused during or as a result of such use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car sharing\n",
    "Only the driver can claim mileage for a journey where two or more GNEI staff share a car. The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Insurance cover for private cars.\n",
    "Accident or breakdown recovery costs, such as AA membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Air Travel\n",
    "Air travel should be booked using GNEI’s preferred travel provider where possible.\n",
    "GNEI prefers lower fares, based on flight arrival and departure times which cannot be changed. Where there is a need for flexibility in departure or arrival times, a different ticket option will have to be requested. Flexible tickets for flights under three hours require approval by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "Membership of a frequent traveller scheme and potential air miles benefits must not deflect from using the most cost-effective airline option for travel.\n",
    "GNEI does not meet the travelling costs of:\n",
    "Employees of contractors\n",
    "Spouses, partners, other family members or friends.\n",
    "Classes of travel:\n",
    "For flights of five hours or less, staff should book restricted tickets in economy.\n",
    "For flights lasting five hours or longer staff may travel premium economy.\n",
    "Where a long international flight is immediately followed by a presentation or meeting, staff may travel by business class. This must be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toll charges\n",
    "Toll charges paid for in the course of a business journey can be claimed. Toll bridges or roads rarely give receipts; therefore the name of the toll bridge or road should be included on the expense claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congestion charges\n",
    "GNEI will not reimburse the cost of any congestion charge for staff or visitors except in exceptional circumstances, e.g. where a member of staff has to collect/deliver equipment to a location and the journey could not be completed on public transport. This must be approved in advance by the relevant School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Parking\n",
    "Reasonable parking costs on business visits and journeys away from the office can be claimed.\n",
    "Hotel parking costs can be claimed if they are charged separately on the bill.\n",
    "If a claimant has to drive to their place of work as part of a business journey, e.g. to collect equipment, parking costs can be claimed. Details of the reason should be included with the claim.\n",
    "The cost of parking at an entertainment venue cannot be claimed.\n",
    "VAT can be reclaimed (where it's charged) on parking fees which cost less than £28 even if the claimant is not able to get a VAT receipt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Hire\n",
    "Approval must be obtained from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager before a car is hired.\n",
    "If hiring a car is the cheapest mode of travel, it should be booked through GNEI's approved car hire provider (for UK or overseas).\n",
    "The car should only be used for business purposes.\n",
    "Rates are inclusive of CDW (Collision Damage Waiver), TPI (Third Party Insurance) and PAI (Personal Accident Insurance).\n",
    "Any petrol bought solely for business purposes can be claimed. A VAT receipt should be obtained for purchases, a credit card receipt is not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Travel\n",
    "This is in relation to a staff conference or student field trip. Prior approval from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager should be obtained before booking a group trip.\n",
    "The same rules apply for each category of travel and overnight costs as for travelling as an individual.\n",
    "All travel (including coach hire) and overnight costs should be booked in advance.\n",
    "GNEI's approved travel provider provides a group travel & conference booking facility, where all elements of the trip can be arranged. This can be used for arranging a business conference, as well as student field trips.\n",
    "Please ensure adequate insurance is in place for all staff and students on the trip. Travel insurance needs to be activated prior to the trip by using the Insurance section of the Finance website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Incidentals\n",
    "Claimants can claim the following goods or services if they are related to the business purpose of the trip:\n",
    "The cost of obtaining a visa for working abroad on GNEI business. These can be obtained from GNEI's approved travel provider.\n",
    "The cost of any vaccinations needed for working abroad.\n",
    "There may be occasions when a claimant needs a second passport, for example when travel to one country could lead to immigration difficulties in travelling on business to some other countries. GNEI will pay this expense.\n",
    "Approval must be obtained in advance from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
