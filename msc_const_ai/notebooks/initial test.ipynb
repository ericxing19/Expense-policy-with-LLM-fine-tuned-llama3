    "GNEI Expenses Policy\n",
    "1. Introduction \n",
    "This Expenses Policy (‘the Policy’) provides guidance to all individuals claiming reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with GNEI business.\n",
    "GNEI is a charity and a large recipient of public funds from UKRI and the Office for Students, grants from other public bodies, charities and fees paid by students. All expenditure should be appropriate and modest in scale.\n",
    "This policy has been prepared in accordance with Income Tax and National Insurance Contribution regulations and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scope\n",
    "This policy applies to all spend on GNEI activities including from research grants and discretionary accounts as well as departmental codes. \n",
    "This policy covers the following areas of expenditure:\n",
    "Travel\n",
    "Overnight costs and allowances\n",
    "Telephone and internet costs\n",
    "Entertainment & Hospitality\n",
    "Training\n",
    "Subscriptions\n",
    "Advances\n",
    "Other Expenditure\n",
    "For items that do not fall under any of the above headings, please refer to your local finance team or Accounts Payable at expenses@gnei.ac.uk.\n",
    "For expense claim procedures, please refer to Annex 1.\n",
    "Generally, GNEI will not reimburse individuals for:\n",
    "Broadband/Internet Provision\n",
    "Equipment\n",
    "Fines\n",
    "Gifts\n",
    "Insurance\n",
    "Mobile Phone Contracts/Hardware\n",
    "Personal Expenditure\n",
    "Professional Subscriptions\n",
    "Stationery\n",
    "For further details on the above exclusions, please refer to Annex 2.\n",
    "Information on VAT aspects which are common to all claims can be found at Annex 3.\n",
    "This policy also provides information on subsistence payments for visiting Research Fellows, please refer to Annex 4.\n",
    "Childcare and caring responsibility can be claimed in certain circumstances, please refer to Annex 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. General Principles\n",
    "GNEI employees and all others engaged in GNEI activity (collectively claimants) will be reimbursed for the actual cost of expenses incurred, wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of GNEI activity as prescribed in this policy.\n",
    "The expense must be justifiable and reasonable according to the information in this policy, and the claim should always be prepared honestly, legally and responsibly. Any breach of the policy could lead to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n",
    "Whilst this policy aims to provide comprehensive guidance on reimbursable out-of- pocket expenditure, it is recommended that staff still seek advance approval from their budget holder or department manager in any situation where interpretation of this policy is in doubt.\n",
    "Employees should be able to procure the majority of goods and services required for GNEI business using the standard purchase to payment procedures using the GNEIFinance system.\n",
    "It is the responsibility of authorised signatories to ensure that this expenses policy is upheld; and it should be noted that individual claims falling outside of the policy may be subject to review and/or rejection by Finance.\n",
    "Electronic images of original receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used should include details of what goods or services have been purchased. Original paper receipts do not need to be stored locally, unless they relate to sponsored research and it is explicit in the terms of the grant that original paper receipts need to be retained.\n",
    "When making a claim for a group, the most senior person present should pay for the expenditure and make the claim.\n",
    "Expenses should be submitted as soon as possible after they have been incurred. Claims must be made within three months. Approval should be gained from the relevant School or PS Head of Finance if the claim is over three months old.\n",
    "It costs a fixed amount to process any claim, so claimants should endeavour not to submit claims for less than £33, unless they represent the total of expenses in a three-month period.\n",
    "If a claimant inadvertently makes an error with an expense claim and has been reimbursed, GNEI will recover the amount from them.\n",
    "Expenses must not be used as a way of rewarding people or encouraging them to work in remote locations.\n",
    "GNEI will not meet the cost of expenses for spouses, partners, other family members or friends of GNEI staff.\n",
    "Claims are checked by Accounts Payable staff and any deemed to be fraudulent will be investigated and referred to GNEI’s Internal Auditors. If a claimant is found to have submitted a fraudulent claim they will face disciplinary proceedings, leading to penalties up to and including summary dismissal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Travel\n",
    "This section details what can be claimed as travel expenses and provides information on specific modes of transport and other expenses associated with travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "General guidance for travelling on GNEI business\n",
    "The cost of business travel, that is, journeys away from your normal place of work while undertaking GNEI business can be claimed.\n",
    "In line with the GNEI travel policy, all business trips in the UK or abroad must be authorised in writing in advance by the GNEI budget holder responsible for making the funds available. It is recommended that this is attached to the claim.\n",
    "The budget holder / manager must agree that the travel is necessary and that alternative methods such as conference call, video conference, phone or email cannot be used or are not appropriate. Consideration should also be given as to how to minimise the environmental impact of travel.\n",
    "This authorisation ensures that anticipated costs are in line with departmental plans, are eligible under the terms of any associated funding, and that subsequent expense claims can be submitted with confidence, subject to the provisions of this policy.\n",
    "GNEI has preferred travel suppliers for airline, hotel and car hire bookings details on these suppliers can be found on the Procurement website. These suppliers should be used for travel bookings where possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Private travel costs\n",
    "The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Travel between home and normal place of work.\n",
    "Business travel broadly similar to the claimant’s normal commute.\n",
    "Recreational travel and accommodation at or near the business travel destination.\n",
    "Travel or accommodation for family or friends accompanying the claimant on the business journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate of exchange\n",
    "If a credit card was used to pay for overseas expenses, the rate charged by the credit card issuer can be claimed. A copy of the statement should be used to evidence the rate used.\n",
    "For employees GNEIExpenses will use a default rate for translating foreign currency transactions; this can be overridden if different to the rate at the time of expenditure and fluctuations will be allowed within a set tolerance. If the automatic rate is overridden, a copy of the bank statement should be included with the claim to back up the rate used.\n",
    "Buying foreign currency is not a genuine business expense and cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Insurance\n",
    "Travel Insurance needs to be activated before traveling overseas, travelling in the UK for fieldtrips or travelling on a business trip where there is an overnight stay or air travel involved.\n",
    "Insurance can be activated by completing a travel insurance request form, which can be found in the Insurance Section on the Finance website.\n",
    "The Insurance team will issue a cover note and provide details of the policy. There is no cost to departments for travel insurance. For regular travellers the Insurance Section can issue annual cover notes on request.\n",
    "If a claimant has an existing medical condition and is not travelling against their doctors’ orders, this is covered by the GNEI Travel Insurance Policy at no extra cost.\n",
    "Personal travel insurance cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel, please refer to Annex 2 for further information on this exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public Transport\n",
    "Journeys made on rail, bus, ferry, river boat, underground, metro or tram services – can be claimed.\n",
    "The most economical method of travel should be used. For example, if the claimant uses public transport in London regularly, they should use an Oyster card rather than paying for single journeys by cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train journeys\n",
    "These should be standard class unless a heavily discounted first-class ticket is booked significantly in advance of the date of travel.\n",
    "If the claimant does travel first class, an explanation must be included on the claim and if necessary the claim will be passed to the relevant School or PS Head of Finance for approval.\n",
    "Trains should be booked in advance where possible via GNEI's approved travel provider or similar rail travel provider as this is the most cost effective option. Tickets can then be collected at the relevant station or sent via post.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tube and bus journeys in London\n",
    "If a London Transport Oyster or contactless credit/debit card is used for business journeys, the details of each individual journey should be entered on the claim, being specific about locations, date and times and purpose of journey.\n",
    "Only the relevant journey should be claimed, not the whole top-up cost, unless the whole top-up will be used for GNEI business travel. Receipts are not necessary for individual journeys but are required if claiming for the whole top- up fee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receipts\n",
    "Relevant tickets or documentation should be kept and attached to the expense claim electronically.\n",
    "Claimants who have a rail or Oyster season ticket enabled to use the underground can only claim for travel if extra expenses are incurred that are not covered by the season ticket and can provide a receipt as proof of the expense.\n",
    "Ticket machines will provide receipts if the ticket is retained by the automatic barrier at the end of a journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taxis\n",
    "Taxi fares can only be claimed for journeys where:\n",
    "It is clearly the most efficient and cost-effective method of transport.\n",
    "Alternative methods of transport are impractical due to pregnancy, disability, illness or injury, luggage or similar.\n",
    "A member of staff is working in the office very late, i.e. after 11pm.\n",
    "Prior approval has been given, where feasible, from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Mileage\n",
    "If a car, motorcycle or bicycle has been used on a business trip the costs can be claimed using a mileage allowance – that is, a sum of money for every business mile travelled. GNEI does not reimburse claims based on actual petrol receipts.\n",
    "GNEI has standard rates for these allowances, depending on the circumstances surrounding the trip (see below).\n",
    "Only additional costs incurred, above what would normally be spent for commuting to work (which are not eligible as a business expense) can be claimed.\n",
    "A car should only be used if it is cheaper and more efficient than public transport. Cars should be shared with other staff members wherever possible.\n",
    "The claim should state the start and end points of the journey, along with the number of miles being claimed.\n",
    "Mileage is paid at the HMRC approved mileage allowance rates:\n",
    "Cars - 50p per mile for the first 11,000 miles in a tax year and 28p per mile thereafter.\n",
    "Motorcycles - 26p per mile.\n",
    "Bicycles - 22p per mile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance\n",
    "It is important that adequate personal insurance cover for business use is in place, as cars, bicycles or motorcycles belonging to claimants are not covered by GNEI’s insurance. Personal insurance cannot be claimed, see Annex 2 for further information.\n",
    "If a staff member uses or allows another member of staff to use a vehicle on GNEI’s business that is insured for third party risks only, GNEI will not be held liable for any of the following:\n",
    "damage or repairs to the vehicle\n",
    "property lost or damaged\n",
    "personal injuries sustained or caused during or as a result of such use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car sharing\n",
    "Only the driver can claim mileage for a journey where two or more GNEI staff share a car. The following cannot be claimed:\n",
    "Insurance cover for private cars.\n",
    "Accident or breakdown recovery costs, such as AA membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Air Travel\n",
    "Air travel should be booked using GNEI’s preferred travel provider where possible.\n",
    "GNEI prefers lower fares, based on flight arrival and departure times which cannot be changed. Where there is a need for flexibility in departure or arrival times, a different ticket option will have to be requested. Flexible tickets for flights under three hours require approval by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "Membership of a frequent traveller scheme and potential air miles benefits must not deflect from using the most cost-effective airline option for travel.\n",
    "GNEI does not meet the travelling costs of:\n",
    "Employees of contractors\n",
    "Spouses, partners, other family members or friends.\n",
    "Classes of travel:\n",
    "For flights of five hours or less, staff should book restricted tickets in economy.\n",
    "For flights lasting five hours or longer staff may travel premium economy.\n",
    "Where a long international flight is immediately followed by a presentation or meeting, staff may travel by business class. This must be pre-approved by the relevant Dean / PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Toll charges\n",
    "Toll charges paid for in the course of a business journey can be claimed. Toll bridges or roads rarely give receipts; therefore the name of the toll bridge or road should be included on the expense claim.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congestion charges\n",
    "GNEI will not reimburse the cost of any congestion charge for staff or visitors except in exceptional circumstances, e.g. where a member of staff has to collect/deliver equipment to a location and the journey could not be completed on public transport. This must be approved in advance by the relevant School/PS Head of Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Parking\n",
    "Reasonable parking costs on business visits and journeys away from the office can be claimed.\n",
    "Hotel parking costs can be claimed if they are charged separately on the bill.\n",
    "If a claimant has to drive to their place of work as part of a business journey, e.g. to collect equipment, parking costs can be claimed. Details of the reason should be included with the claim.\n",
    "The cost of parking at an entertainment venue cannot be claimed.\n",
    "VAT can be reclaimed (where it's charged) on parking fees which cost less than £28 even if the claimant is not able to get a VAT receipt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Car Hire\n",
    "Approval must be obtained from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager before a car is hired.\n",
    "If hiring a car is the cheapest mode of travel, it should be booked through GNEI's approved car hire provider (for UK or overseas).\n",
    "The car should only be used for business purposes.\n",
    "Rates are inclusive of CDW (Collision Damage Waiver), TPI (Third Party Insurance) and PAI (Personal Accident Insurance).\n",
    "Any petrol bought solely for business purposes can be claimed. A VAT receipt should be obtained for purchases, a credit card receipt is not sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group Travel\n",
    "This is in relation to a staff conference or student field trip. Prior approval from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager should be obtained before booking a group trip.\n",
    "The same rules apply for each category of travel and overnight costs as for travelling as an individual.\n",
    "All travel (including coach hire) and overnight costs should be booked in advance.\n",
    "GNEI's approved travel provider provides a group travel & conference booking facility, where all elements of the trip can be arranged. This can be used for arranging a business conference, as well as student field trips.\n",
    "Please ensure adequate insurance is in place for all staff and students on the trip. Travel insurance needs to be activated prior to the trip by using the Insurance section of the Finance website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Travel Incidentals\n",
    "Claimants can claim the following goods or services if they are related to the business purpose of the trip:\n",
    "The cost of obtaining a visa for working abroad on GNEI business. These can be obtained from GNEI's approved travel provider.\n",
    "The cost of any vaccinations needed for working abroad.\n",
    "There may be occasions when a claimant needs a second passport, for example when travel to one country could lead to immigration difficulties in travelling on business to some other countries. GNEI will pay this expense.\n",
    "Approval must be obtained in advance from the budget holder or departmental administrator/manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Annex 1 – Expense claim procedures\n",
    "How to make a claim\n",
    "All GNEI employees and students with a UK bank account must claim expenses online via the GNEIExpenses module on GNEIFinance. Anyone else should use the external visitor system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Receipts\n",
    "For GNEI employees, electronic images of original VAT receipts must be attached to all claims. Once submitted each claim will be routed automatically to the appropriate approver(s) and Accounts Payable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For students or external individuals, a claim will be processed once the approved claim form and all supporting paper receipts have reached Accounts Payable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see Annex 3 for further information on VAT receipts. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of business expenditure. All receipts used must include details of the goods or services purchased. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the necessary receipts or documentation is not available claimants should obtain approval from the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance prior to submitting the claim, and provide evidence of this approval attached to the claim. Use the Justification field in GNEIExpenses to notify Accounts Payable that the approval is attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approval\n",
    "GNEI operates a system of delegated authorisation to staff and approval limits are set out in the GNEI Financial Regulations. Expense approvers should be aware of the funds available in the project to which the claim is being charged to.\n",
    "\n",
    "All expense claims require authorisation prior to payment. This authorisation is in line with GNEI’s Financial Authorised Signatory hierarchy. It is the responsibility of the claimant to ensure that the approver will confirm authorisation for each item in the claim. Claimants may be personally liable for expenses not subsequently approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approver(s) must personally review and then approve the claim. Approvers are expected to review claims promptly and consider the following before approving:\n",
    "The appropriateness and quantum of the expenditure\n",
    "The expenses category chosen for each item\n",
    "The project code(s) charged\n",
    "Any policy violations\n",
    "That receipts or receipt images correspond to the claim and constitute itemised receipts, not credit card slips/bank statements.\n",
    "That items within the claim meet the terms of the research funder’s terms and\n",
    "conditions (if related to sponsored research).\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are queries on any of the above, claims should be challenged by the Approver and\n",
    "rejected if incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expense claims not appropriately authorised will be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Annex 2 – Exclusions\n",
    "In exceptional circumstances claims for some of these items may be allowed, prior approval should be obtained from the relevant PS Director, Faculty Director of Operations or School/PS Head of Finance. If prior approval is not obtained there is no guarantee that expenditure will be reimbursed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadband/Internet Provision\n",

    "Fines for motoring offences\n",
    "\n",
    "Gifts\n",
    "GNEI will not pay for gifts in any circumstances. Gifts for staff should be purchased using personal funds or via a staff collection. Gifts should not be claimed via expenses, nor purchased via iProcurement or a GNEI Purchasing Card.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance\n",
    "Travel insurance should be obtained from the Insurance section of the GNEI Finance website. Personal travel insurance policies will not cover claimants whilst abroad on GNEI’s behalf, and cannot be claimed as GNEI already provides cover for business travel. If a claim is received for travel insurance it will not be paid. Personal car/bicycle/motorcycle insurance cannot be claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile Phone Contracts/Hardware\n",
    "Monthly contract charges and hardware cannot be claimed for. If a mobile phone is required for work purposes it should be obtained from ISD Telecoms. \n",
    "GNEI will pay for the cost of business calls made from a personal mobile phone, please see the ‘Telephone costs’ section of the GNEI Expenses Policy.\n",

    "Annex 3 – VAT\n",
    "VAT\n",
    "GNEI can reclaim the VAT charged on some business expenses. In order to make a proper claim GNEI needs valid receipts to provide appropriate evidence. It is the claimant’s responsibility to obtain a receipt showing VAT where it applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As defined by HMRC, original VAT receipts must accompany all claims. Credit card slips or credit card/bank statements will not be accepted as evidence of expenditure. All receipts should show the following information:\n",

    "Date of supply and date of issue if different\n",
    "Description of the goods or services\n",
    "For each VAT rate the total amount payable including VAT and the VAT rate charged\n",
    "Name and address of person to whom the services are supplied (if appropriate)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Annex 4 - Visiting Research Fellows Subsistence Payments\n",
    "Subsistence payments should be claimed via a Visiting Research Fellow form, which will be processed as a manual  expense form if the following conditions are met:\n",
    "The general rule is to determine if an overseas visitor is an employee or not. If the overseas visitor does not undertake any duties (other than research) normally performed by GNEI staff and they are not subject to the usual terms and conditions of employment, then payments may be made to them without deduction of PAYE and NI.\n",
    "Usual terms and conditions of employment would include such matters as the ability of GNEI to determine hours worked, location of work, to set a probationary period and entitlement of the payee to holiday pay, sick pay and to join a pension scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual must be visiting for less than two years. \n",
    "\n",
    "Subsistence payments may be made gross on the Visiting Research Fellow form if the following conditions are met:\n",
    "There is no contract of employment.\n",
    "There is no contract for services, whether written or verbal.\n",
    "The visiting Research Fellow does not undertake any duties (apart from research) normally performed by staff of GNEI.\n",
    "The grant is paid to cover living and travel expenses.\n",
    "The visiting Research Fellow is here for a maximum of two years.\n",
    "The visiting Research Fellow form must clearly state that the payment is for travel and subsistence of an overseas visiting researcher.\n",
    "The individual’s home country and institution address is included on the form.\n",
    "The source of funding is stated on the form.\n",
    "If the visiting Research Fellow does undertake any teaching duties or hold seminars, then a proportion of the payments made to them must be attributed to these duties. Payments may still be made gross but they must be reported to the HMRC. Details of all such payments in any tax year (6 April to 5 April) must be returned to the Taxation and Commercial Accountant in Finance by 30 April each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Annex 5 - Childcare and Caring Responsibility costs\n",
    "Various funders now allow childcare or caring responsibility costs to be claimed as allowable expenses if the costs are incurred for working outside normal working patterns (e.g. childcare or eldercare costs while the primary carer attends a conference outside usual contracted hours).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to your funder’s terms and conditions or obtain permission from them prior to incurring the expenditure. If you require further guidance please contact Award Services, Research and Innovation Services award-services@gnei.ac.uk\n",
